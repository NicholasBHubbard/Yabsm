Every directory specified in the configs that is not obviously a fake directory 
is a FHS compliant directory in order for these tests to work properly
on any GNU/Linux OS.

The configs being tested are nonsensical. For example they define
subvolumes that have the same path as the snapshot_directory, which is
allowed but probably not something anybody would want.
