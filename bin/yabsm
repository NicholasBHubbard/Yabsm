=head1 Installation

In the near future Yabsm should be available in all major Linux distribution
repositories.

Until then Yabsm can be installed with L<cpanminus|https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpanminus>.

    # apt install cpanminus
    # cpanm App::Yabsm

=head1 The Yabsm Daemon

    usage: yabsm <daemon|d> [--help] [start] [stop] [restart] [status] [init]

Snapshots and backups are performed by the Yabsm daemon. The Yabsm daemon must be
started as root so it can initialize its runtime environment, which includes
creating a locked user named I<yabsm> (and a group named I<yabsm>) that the
daemon will run as. You can initialize the daemon's runtime environment without
actually starting the daemon by running C<yabsm daemon init>.

When the daemon starts, it reads the C</etc/yabsm.conf> file that specifies its
L<configuration|/"Configuration"> to determine when to schedule the snapshots and
backups and how to perform them. If the Yabsm daemon is already running and you
make a configuration change, you must run C<yabsm daemon restart> to apply the
changes.

=head3 Initialize Daemon Runtime Environment

You can use the command C<yabsm daemon init> to initialize the daemon's runtime
environment without actually starting the daemon. Running this command creates
the I<yabsm> user and group, gives the I<yabsm> user sudo access to btrfs-progs,
creates I<yabsms> SSH keys, and creates the directories needed for performing all
the I<snaps>, I<ssh_backups>, and I<local_backups> defined in C</etc/yabsm.conf>.

=head3 Daemon Logging

The Yabsm daemon logs all of its errors to C</var/log/yabsm>. If, for example,
you have an I<ssh_backup> that is not being performed, the first thing you should
do is check the logs.

=head1 Configuration

The Yabsm daemon is configured via the C</etc/yabsm.conf> file.

You can run the command C<yabsm config check> that will check your config and
output useful error messages if there are any problems.

=head3 Configuration Grammar

First things first: you must specify a C<yabsm_dir> that Yabsm will use for
storing snapshots and as a cache for holding data needed for performing snapshots
and backups. Most commonly this directory is set to C</.snapshots/yabsm>. Yabsm
will take this directory literally so you almost certainly want the path to end
in C</yabsm>. If this directory does not exist, the Yabsm daemon will create it
automatically when it starts.

There are 4 different configuration objects: I<subvols>, I<snaps>,
I<ssh_backups>, and I<local_backups>. The general form of each configuration
object is:

    type name {
        key=val
        ...
    }

All configuration objects share a namespace, so you must make sure they all have
unique names. You can define as many configuration objects as you want.

=head4 Subvols

A subvol is the simplest configuration object and is used to give a name to a
L<btrfs subvolume|https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/SysadminGuide#Subvolumes>
on your system. A subvol definition accepts one field named C<mountpoint> which
takes a value that is a path to a subvolume.

    subvol home_subvol {
        mountpoint=/home
    }

=head4 Timeframes

We need to understand timeframes before we can understand I<snaps>,
I<ssh_backups>, and I<local_backups>. There are 5 timeframes: 5minute, hourly,
daily, weekly, and monthly.

I<Snaps>, I<ssh_backups>, and I<local_backups> are performed in one or more
timeframes. For example, a I<ssh_backup> may be configured to take backups in the
I<hourly> and I<weekly> categories, which means that we want to backup every hour
and once a week.

The following table describes in plain English what each timeframe means:

    5minute -> Every 5 minutes.
    hourly  -> At the beginning of every hour.
    daily   -> Every day at one or more times of the day.
    weekly  -> Once a week on a specific weekday at a specific time.
    monthly -> Once a month on a specific day at a specific time.

To specify the timeframes you want, you set the value of C<timeframes> to a comma
separated list of timeframe values. For example, this is how you specify that you
want every timeframe:

    timeframes=5minute,hourly,daily,weekly,monthly

Each timeframe you specify adds new required settings for the configuration
object. Here is a table that shows the timeframe settings:

    5minute -> 5minute_keep
    hourly  -> hourly_keep
    daily   -> daily_keep,   daily_times
    weekly  -> weekly_keep,  weekly_time,  weekly_day
    monthly -> monthly_keep, monthly_time, monthly_day

Any C<*_keep> setting defines how many snapshots/backups you want to keep at one
time for the configuration object. A common configuration is to keep 48 hourly
snapshots so you can go back 2 days in one-hour increments.

The C<daily_times> setting for daily snapshots takes a comma separated list of
I<hh:mm> times. Yabsm will perform the snapshot/backup every day at all the given
times.

The weekly timeframe requires a C<weekly_day> setting that takes a day of week
string such as I<monday>, I<thursday>, or I<saturday> and a I<weekly_time>
setting that takes a I<hh:mm> time. The weekly snapshot/backup will be performed
on the given day of the week at the given time.

The monthly timeframe requires a C<monthly_day> setting that takes an integer
between 1-31 and a C<monthly_time> setting that takes a I<hh:mm> time. The
monthly snapshot/backup will be performed on the given day of the month at the
given time.

=head4 Snaps

A I<snap> represents a snapshot configuration for some I<subvol>. Here is an
example of a I<snap> that snapshots I<home_subvol> twice a day.

    snap home_subvol_snap {
        subvol=home_subvol
        timeframes=daily
        daily_keep=62 # two months
        daily_times=13:40,23:59
    }

=head4 SSH Backups

A I<ssh_backup> represents a backup configuration that sends snapshots over a
network via SSH. See this example of a I<ssh_backup> that backs up I<home_subvol>
to C<larry@192.168.1.73:/backups/yabsm/laptop_home> every night at midnight:

    ssh_backup home_subvol_larry_server {
        subvol=home_subvol
        ssh_dest=larry@192.168.1.73
        dir=/backups/yabsm/laptop_home
        timeframes=daily
        daily_keep=31
        daily_times=23:59
    }

The difficult part of configuring a I<ssh_backup> is making sure the SSH server
is properly configured. You can test that a I<ssh_backup> is able to be performed
by running C<yabsm config ssh-check E<lt>SSH_BACKUPE<gt>>. For a I<ssh_backup> to
be able to be performed the following conditions must be satisfied:

=over 4

=item *

The host's I<yabsm> user can sign into the SSH destination (I<ssh_dest>) using
key based authentication. To achieve this you must add the I<yabsm> users SSH key
(available via C<# yabsm ssh print-key>) to the server user's
C<$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys> file.

=item *

The remote backup directory (I<dir>) is an existing directory residing on a btrfs
filesystem that the remote user has read and write permissions to.

=item *

The SSH user has root access to btrfs-progs via sudo. To do this you can add a
file containing a string like C<larry ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/btrfs> to
a file in C</etc/sudoers.d/>.

=back

=head4 Local Backups

A I<local_backup> represents a backup configuration that sends snapshots to a
partition mounted on the host OS. This is useful for sending snapshots to an
external hard drive plugged into your computer.

Here is an example I<local_backup> that backs up C<home_subvol> every hour, and
once a week.

    local_backup home_subvol_easystore {
        subvol=home_subvol
        dir=/mnt/easystore/backups/yabsm/home_subvol
        timeframes=hourly,weekly
        hourly_keep=48
        weekly_keep=56
        weekly_day=sunday
        weekly_time=23:59
    }

The backup directory (C<dir>) must be an existing directory residing on a btrfs
filesystem that the I<yabsm> user has read permission on.

=head1 Configuration Querying

Yabsm comes with a C<config> command that allows you to check and query your
configuration.

    usage: yabsm <config|c> [--help] [check ?file] [ssh-check <SSH_BACKUP>]
                            [ssh-key] [yabsm-user-home] [yabsm_dir] [subvols]
                            [snaps] [ssh_backups] [local_backups] [backups]

The C<check ?file> subcommand checks that C<?file> is a valid Yabsm configuration
file and if not prints useful error messages. If the C<?file> argument is omitted
it defaults to C</etc/yabsm.conf>.

The C<ssh-check E<lt>SSH_BACKUPE<gt>> subcommand checks that C<E<lt>SSH_BACKUPE<gt>> can be
performed and if not prints useful error messages. See the section
L<SSH Backups|/"SSH Backups"> for an explanation on the configuration required
for performing an I<ssh_backup>.

The C<ssh-key> subcommand prints the I<yabsm> user's public SSH key.

All of the other subcommands query for information derived from your
 C</etc/yabsm.conf>:

    subvols         -> The names of all subvols.
    snaps           -> The names of all snaps.
    ssh_backups     -> The names of all ssh_backups.
    local_backups   -> The names of all local_backups.
    backups         -> The names of all ssh_backups and local_backups.
    yabsm_dir       -> The directory used as the yabsm_dir.
    yabsm_user_home -> The 'yabsm' users home directory.

=head1 Finding Snapshots

Now that we know how to configure Yabsm to take snapshots, we are going to want
to locate those snapshots. Yabsm comes with a command C<find> that allows you to
locate snapshots and backups using a simple query language. Here is the usage
string for the C<find> command.

    usage: yabsm <find|f> [--help] [<SNAP|SSH_BACKUP|LOCAL_BACKUP> <QUERY>]

Here are a few examples:

    $ yabsm find home_snap back-2-mins
    $ yabsm f root_ssh_backup 'after b-2-m'
    $ yabsm f home_local_backup 10:45

The first argument is the name of any I<snap>, I<ssh_backup>, or I<local_backup>.
Because these configuration entities share the same namespace there is no risk of
ambiguity.

The second argument is a snapshot location query. There are 7 types of queries:

    all                 -> Every snapshot sorted newest to oldest
    newest              -> The most recent snapshot/backup.
    oldest              -> The oldest snapshot/backup.
    after   TIME        -> All the snapshot/backups that are newer than TIME.
    before  TIME        -> All the snapshot/backups that are older than TIME.
    between TIME1 TIME2 -> All the snapshot/backups that were taken between TIME1 and TIME2.
    TIME                -> The snapshot/backup that was taken closest to TIME.

=head2 Time Abbreviations

In the list above the C<TIME> variables stand for a I<time abbreviation>.

There are two different kinds of I<time abbreviations>: I<relative times> and
I<immediate times>.

=head3 Relative Times

A relative time comes in the form C<back-AMOUNT-UNIT>, where C<back> can be
abbreviated to C<b>, C<AMOUNT> is a positive integer, and C<UNIT> is either
C<minutes>, C<hours>, or C<days>. Each C<UNIT> can be abbreviated:

    minutes -> mins, m
    hours   -> hrs, h
    days    -> d

Here are some English descriptions of I<relative times>.

    back-5-h  -> 5 hours ago
    b-10-m    -> 10 minutes ago
    b-24-days -> 24 days ago

=head3 Immediate Times

An I<immediate_time> is an abbreviation for a time/date denoted by C<yr_mon_day_hr:min>.

There are 7 I<immediate_time> forms, the following table gives an example of each
form:

    yr_mon_day_hr:min -> 2020_5_13_23:59
    yr_mon_day        -> 2020_12_25
    mon_day_hr:min    -> 12_25_8:30
    mon_day_hr        -> 12_25_8
    mon_day           -> 12_25
    hr:min            -> 23:59

The I<immediate_time> abbreviation rules are simple. If the C<yr>, C<mon>, or
C<day> is omitted then the current year, month, or day is assumed. If the C<hr>
or C<min> is omitted then they are assumed to be 0. Therefore C<2020_12_25> is
always the same as C<2020_12_25_00:00>. If the current day is I<2020/12/25>, then
C<23:59> is the same as C<2020_12_25_23:59>.
