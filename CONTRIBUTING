* Setup

To hack on YABSM you will need an [[https://metacpan.org/pod/App::plx][App::plx]] environment with a Perl v5.16.3
interpreter. YABSM comes with a bash script =devel-tools/devel-bootstrap= that
will automatically set up the proper environment.

After you bootstrap your yabsm environment you can use your Perl v5.16.3
interpreter with =.plx/plx --perl ...=.

* Deployment

When a user installs YABSM only 2 files are installed onto their system. There
files are =export/yabsm.fatpack.pl= and =export/yabsm.conf.example=.

All dependencies are packed into one script using [[https://metacpan.org/pod/App::FatPacker][App::FatPacker]]. YABSM provides
a bash script =devel-tools/yabsm-fatpack= that will automatically fatpack YABSM
into =export/yabsm.fatpack.pl=.

All dependencies must be specified in the DEPENDENCIES file at the root of the
YABSM repository.
