#
# This configuration makes sense for a system that has two btrfs subvolumes
# mounted at '/' and '/home'.

subvol root_subvol {
    mountpoint=/
}

### Snaps ###

# A 'snap' represents a configuration for taking readonly snapshots of some
# 'subvol'.
#
# See the 'Snaps' section of '$ man yabsm' for a detailed explanation.

snap root_snap {

    # every possible timeframe
    timeframes=5minute,hourly,daily,weekly,monthly

    5minute_keep=12 # back 1 hour in 5 minute increments

    hourly_keep=48  # back 2 days in hour increments

    daily_keep=63 # back a month
    daily_times=09:00,23:59 # twice a day

### SSH Backups ###

# A 'ssh_backup' represents a configuration for performing incremental backups

### Local Backups ###

# A 'local_backup' represents a configuration for performing incremental backups
