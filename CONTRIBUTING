* Setup

YABSM comes with a bash script =devel-tools/devel-bootstrap= that initializes a
YABSM development environment. This script will install a Perl v5.16.3
interpreter into the root of the YABSM repository using [[https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Build][Perl::Build]] and then
sets up an [[https://metacpan.org/pod/App::plx][App::plx]] environment around this new interpreter. Finally all the
dependencies specified in /DEPENDENCIES are installed using [[https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpanminus][App::cpanminus]].

All of these steps are taken care of by =devel-tools/devel-bootstrap= so all you
have to do is run the script.

* Development

To run YABSM code you must run perl through [[https://metacpan.org/pod/App::plx][App::plx]]. The
=devel-tools/devel-bootstrap= script that you just ran installed the plx
executable to =local/bin/plx=. To run YABSM code you must run perl through plx,
for example to run the tests for YABSM base library you can run =local/bin/plx src/t/Base.t=.

* Deployment

When a user installs YABSM only 2 files are installed onto their system. These
files are =export/yabsm.fatpack.pl= and =export/yabsm.conf.example=.

YABSM and all of its dependencies are packed into one script using
[[https://metacpan.org/pod/App::FatPacker][App::FatPacker]]. YABSM provides a bash script =devel-tools/yabsm-fatpack= that
will automatically fatpack all of YABSM into =export/yabsm.fatpack.pl=.

If you add any new dependencies to YABSM you must specify them in the
[[./DEPENDENCIES][DEPENDENCIES]] file.
