* Setup

YABSM comes with a bash script =devel-tools/devel-init= that initializes a
YABSM development environment. This script depends on you having [[https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpanminus][App::cpanminus]]
and [[https://metacpan.org/pod/App::plx][App::plx]] installed. Cpanminus is packaged under most GNU/Linux distributions
under the either the name =cpanm= or =cpanminus=.

Once you have cpanminus installed you can install plx with the command:
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ cpanm App::plx
#+END_SRC
Now you can execute the =devel-tools/devel-init= script. This script will
install a Perl v5.16.3 interpreter into the root of the YABSM project directory
and setup up a plx environment.

After running =devel-tools/devel-init= you can can run and test the YABSM code
with =plx --perl [<args>]=.

* Deployment

When a user installs YABSM only 2 files are installed onto their system. These
files are =export/yabsm.fatpack.pl= and =export/yabsm.conf.example=.

YABSM and all of its dependencies are packed into one script using
[[https://metacpan.org/pod/App::FatPacker][App::FatPacker]]. YABSM provides a bash script =devel-tools/yabsm-fatpack= that
will automatically fatpack all of YABSM into =export/yabsm.fatpack.pl=.

All dependencies must be specified in the DEPENDENCIES file at the root of the
YABSM repository.
